## BDD
A user comes to the app, they key in their username, the system takes the name as the search query and appends to the Github API url and gets the User's profile and the repos in his/her account. In the display the profile photo of the user is displayed his/her username and repos. the repos are highlighted depending on the lnaguge that is widely used in the project.
The user can also search for repos from from the app. While in the home page the user can enter the repo name and the name will be used to fetch repos with almost the same name. the repos are displayed with information of the owner name and profile, title of the repo and language used.
